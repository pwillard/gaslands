# gaslands

This is a repository for Gaslands mods for Hot Wheels and other similar scale cars for use with Gaslands tabletop game. 

These are parts that I have created using Blender 2.9 and printed on my Elegoo Mars 2.

I will list parts here as I add them.

Part #1:    Small Hood Scoop.
Part #2:    Small Straight Pipes.
Part #3:    Based on JKS Low Profile scoop.
